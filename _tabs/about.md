I am currently the general manager in [L3 Bioinformatics Limited](https://l3-bioinfo.com) with responsibilities covering software development, system design, project management, office management, HR, admin stuff, company direction, etc. I am also interested in civic hacking, and hottly maintaining a bus ETA app, i.e., [hkbus.app](https://hkbus.app). There are several side projects I have done and willing to work them out.

As the [HK National Security Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_national_security_law) has launched, Hong Kong becomes more secure and full of opportunity. To echo the chance provided by the [Greater Bay Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong%E2%80%93Hong_Kong%E2%80%93Macao_Greater_Bay_Area), I train my coding skills with [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/chunlaw/) and willing to move out from Hong Kong. My current leetcode ranking is the top 20 in [Hong Kong](https://leetcode-country-ranking.herokuapp.com/country/HK).

Hope to build up my technology growth footprint throughout the years.
