[Edgitor](https://edgitor.chunlaw.io) have recently launched as a graph editor tool for editing simple vertex-edge graph. You may create and visualise your own graph by simply stating the list of edges.

## Highlight Features:

- Arranging graph as a tree/grid/circle
- Flipping, rotating or transpose the graph
- Zooming in/out, panning the view port
- Supporting both undirected and directed graph
- Importing/exporting as JSON
- Saving as SVG
- Customising individual node styles
- No limitation on the number of nodes
- Apart from the sample graphs in the above cover image, some examples are provided below.
